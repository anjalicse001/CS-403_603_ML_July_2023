# The repository contains the code and results in notebook format for the comparative analysis of credit card fraud detection machine learning and deep learning techniques.


CCF is an increasing threat to financial institutions. Fraudsters tend to constantly come up with new fraud methods. A robust classifier can handle the changing nature of fraud. Accurately predicting fraud cases and reducing false-positive cases is the foremost priority of a fraud detection system. The performance of ML methods varies for each individual business case. The type of input data is a dominant factor that drives different ML methods. For detecting CCF, the number of features, number of transactions, and correlation between the features are essential factors in determining the modelâ€™s performance. DL methods, such as CNNs and their layers, are associated with the processing of text and the baseline model. Using these methods for the detection of credit cards yields better performance than traditional algorithms.
